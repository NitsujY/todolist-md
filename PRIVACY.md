# Privacy Policy for TodoList MD

**Last Updated:** December 3, 2025

## Introduction

TodoList MD ("we", "our", or "us") is an open-source task management application that stores your data directly in your Google Drive™. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring you have full control over your data.

## Data We Collect

We do **not** collect, store, or share any of your personal data on our own servers.

### Google User Data
When you sign in with Google, our application receives:
*   **Basic Profile Information:** Your email address and name (used only to display your identity within the app).
*   **Google Drive Access:** We request access to specific files in your Google Drive to store your todo lists.

## How We Use Your Data

We use your data solely to provide the functionality of the application:
1.  **Storage:** Your todo lists are stored as Markdown (`.md`) files directly in your Google Drive.
2.  **Authentication:** We use your Google account to verify your identity and access your Drive.

## Google Drive Scopes

We use the following Google Drive scope:
*   `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file`: This "Sensitive" scope allows us to access **only** the files and folders that you explicitly open or create with this app. We cannot see any other files in your Google Drive.

## Data Sharing

We do **not** share your data with any third parties, advertisers, or external services. Your data remains strictly between your browser and Google's servers.

## Data Retention

Since we do not store your data on our servers, we have no data to retain or delete. Your files exist only in your Google Drive, and you can delete them at any time using the Google Drive interface.
