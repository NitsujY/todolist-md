# Serverless, Plugin-First Markdown Todo App

A Proof-of-Concept (PoC) for a Todo App that runs entirely as a static website (SPA) using Markdown as the data source. **This app is designed to work primarily with local files or remote markdown sources, giving you full control over your data without relying on a proprietary database.**

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: React (Vite)
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **State Management**: Zustand
- **Markdown Parser**: Unified / Remark

## Architecture

- **Storage Adapter Pattern**: Supports swapping between Local Storage and Mock Cloud Storage.
- **Plugin System**: Allows extending the UI and Markdown transformation via plugins.
- **Markdown-First**: The source of truth is a Markdown string.

## Getting Started

1.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  Run the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

3.  Build for production:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

## Features

- **Markdown-First**: Your data is just Markdown. Edit it as a list or as raw text.
- **Local File System Access**: Open and edit local files and folders directly from your browser (Chromium-based browsers).
- **Drag & Drop**: Reorder tasks intuitively.
- **Undo/Redo**: Mistakes are fine with full history support.
- **Search**: Quickly find tasks across your list.
- **Focus Mode**: Dim distractions and focus on one task at a time (via Plugin).
- **Customizable UI**:
    - **Themes**: Light, Dark, and System preference.
    - **Compact Mode**: For when you want to see more.
    - **Font Size**: Adjustable text size.
- **Plugin System**: Extensible architecture (includes Due Date, Focus Mode, and Priority Highlighter plugins).
- **Storage Options**:
    - **Local Storage**: Quick start, data stays in browser.
    - **File System**: Edit real files on your disk.
    - **Cloud**: (Mock) Architecture ready for cloud backends.

## Markdown Syntax Guide

The app parses standard Markdown to generate the task list. Here is how it works:

- **Tasks**: Use standard Markdown task lists.
    - `- [ ] Task to do` -> Open Task
    - `- [x] Completed task` -> Completed Task
- **Sections**: Use Markdown headings to create sections.
    - `# Section Name` or `## Section Name`
- **Descriptions**: Use blockquotes immediately after a task to add a description.
    - `> This is a note about the task`
- **Tags**: Use hash symbols to tag tasks.
    - `- [ ] Buy milk #groceries #urgent`
    - Use `\#` to escape a hash symbol if you don't want a tag (e.g. `\#1`).
